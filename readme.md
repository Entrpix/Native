## DO NOT USE
- This only does HTML and CSS rewriting
- 99% of sites won't work (static sites should work fine)

## Deployment
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/entrpix/native
$ cd native
$ npm i 
$ npm start
```

## How to Use
- Add `/url/*URL*` to the end of the URL
  - Replace `*URL*` with the URL of the page you want to visit

## TODO

- [X] Correct MIME types for text and images
- [X] Inject Rewriter
- [X] Attribute Rewriter
- [X] Site Blocklist
